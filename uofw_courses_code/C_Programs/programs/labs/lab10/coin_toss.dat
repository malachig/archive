Since brass,
nor stone,
nor earth,
nor boundless sea,
But sad mortality,
o'ersways their power,
How with this rage,
shall beauty hold a plea,
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out,
Against the wreckful siege of battering days,
When rocks imprenable are not so stout,
Nor gates of steel so strong,
but time decays?
O fearful meditation!
Where, alack!
Shall Time's best jewel,
from Time's chest lie hid?
Or what strong hand,
can hold his swift foot back?
