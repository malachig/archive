DISCLAIMER
 
 Molnar \ Kucalaba Productions does not support killing Bob Saget in reality.
If you kill him, don't blame it on us.  (If you are stupid enough to kill
him, then you might be stupid enough to blame us.)  This game also contains 
loads of copyright violations.  We don't care.

 Also, this game, like every other game that's been made in the last 2 years,
contains extreme violence.  If you don't like violence, don't play it, and 
most importantly, don't bother us about it.  

 On the other hand, if you like the game, feel free to write us and tell us 
all about it!  It encourages us to waste more time on these things.  We are
open to requests for another game, but we don't have any plans to make
another one, and if we do use your idea, we probably won't give you credit
for it because we probably hate the same people that you do.




BACKGROUND INFORMATION
 
 Anyone who watches TV often, which would include just about everyone in the
world except Amish people, has seen Bob Saget.  Most know him as the host
of "America's Funniest Home Videos".  Other people might recognize him
as one of those idiots from "Full House".  Maybe you know him from somewhere
else.

 Bob tells the worst, most annoying jokes in the world, and the effect is 
only enhanced by that dopey smile he always sports.  He might not write the
jokes, but there's no disputing the fact that he tells them.  Plus, all the
shows he appears on are absolutely horrible.  Anyways, it's hard not to hate 
Bob Saget, so we thought if we made a game where you killed him, someone out 
there might enjoy it.




GAME TIPS
 
 First and foremost, this is not really a game.  All you do is kill Bob.  If
killed properly, you will know when the game is over.  The biggest tip we
can offer you is to start at the top of his head and work your way down.
Remember that, because you could be waiting a long, long time for something
to happen if you don't.

 Playing the game requires no explanation, but here's one anyways.  Aim
with the mouse.  Shoot with the left mouse button.  Hit escape to leave
if you can't beat the game.




TROUBLESHOOTING

 If Bob Saget Killer 2000 crashes your computer, it's likely due to a
Sound Blaster problem.  Bob Saget Killer 2000 takes your SB information
directly from your BLASTER environment settings, so make sure that
is configured correctly, which is probably already is.

 If problems persist, start the game from the command line with the "/x" 
parameter, which will deactivate all sound routines.  Sound is a huge part
of any game, especially this game, so it might suck without sound.
Example :

c:\> killbob /x
 
 If you happen to hear only music, but no sound effects, then exit the
game and try something else that has sound effects, like Wolfenstein 3D
or some other game.  Then try playing Bob Saget Killer 2000.  That fixes
the problem on my computer.
