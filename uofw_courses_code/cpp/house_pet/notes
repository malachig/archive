Notes on compilation.  This program, house_pet is made up of three files:

	house_pet.cpp -> contains the Method Code (definition)
			 ie. it contains the methods for the class HousePet.
			 The header file house_pet.h doesn't make any sense
			 without it (and vice versa).

	
	house_pet.h -> contains the actual class definition.
		       is it contains the attributes and behaviours of the 
		       class, but not the methods for those behaviours.

	house_pet_main_2.cpp -> The actual main() program.  It utilizes the 
			        header and therefore also needs house_pet.cpp.


	To Compile this program you must do something like:

	c++ house_pet_main_2.cpp house_pet.cpp

	Both files are compiled and produce a single object file (a.out by 
	default).
