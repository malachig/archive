I have included a small sampling of the programs I have written during my recent studies.  They are mostly programs written as assignments or lab exercises for courses I have taken at the University of Winnipeg.  

I do not consider myself a programmer by any stretch of the imagination.  My training is heavily weighted in Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics.  However, I believe that I have been given a solid introduction to the theory and practice of object oriented programming.

Having learned the syntax of R, Basic, C, C++, HTML, and CFML I am confidant that I could pick up other programming or scripting languages very quickly.  I also have some basic familiarity with *nix languages such as AWK, and BASH.
